If (name of school district) adopts the proposed tax rate, (name of school district) will collect (estimated dollar amount of property tax revenue to be collected in the current tax year)." (c-4)  For purposes of Subsection (c-3): (1)  "Adjusted collection rate" for a school district means the rate computed by subtracting one from the product of: (A)  the sum of one and the enrollment growth rate; and (B)  the sum of one and the inflation rate. (2)  "Adjusted tax collections" for a school district means an amount equal to the product of: (A)  the preceding year's estimated levy; and (B)  the sum of one and the adjusted collection rate for the district. (3)  "Enrollment growth rate" means the rate of growth of a school district's enrollment during the preceding school year, expressed in decimal form rounded to the nearest thousandth, determined by the district using information provided by the agency.

If a school district elects to adopt a tax rate before adopting a budget, the district must provide [publish] notice and hold a meeting for the purpose of discussing the proposed tax rate as provided by this section.
