89(2) HB 78 - Introduced version - Bill Text 89S20026 MLH-F By: Bell of Montgomery H.B. No. 78 A BILL TO BE ENTITLED AN ACT relating to the authority of the legislature or a state court to declare certain federal actions to be unconstitutional federal actions, including the effect and enforcement of such a declaration. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS: SECTION 1.  (a) This Act may be cited as the Texas Sovereignty Act. (b)  The legislature finds that: (1)  The people of the several states forming the United States of America created the federal government to be their agent for certain enumerated powers delegated by the states and the people to the federal government through the United States Constitution. (2)  The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution confirms the intent and understanding of the people of the United States that all powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, or prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. (3)  Each power delegated to the federal government by the United States Constitution is constitutionally limited to that power as it was understood and exercised at the time it was delegated.  An amendment to the Constitution as ratified by the states is required to expand or limit a constitutionally delegated power. (4)  The United States Constitution authorizes the United States Congress to exercise only those specific powers enumerated in Section 8, Article I, United States Constitution, and those other powers as may be delegated to Congress through amendments to the Constitution as ratified by the states. (5)  Article VI, United States Constitution, makes supreme the Constitution and federal laws enacted pursuant to the Constitution, further requiring that public officials at all levels and in all branches of government support the Constitution. (6)  The power delegated to the United States Congress to regulate commerce among the several states under Section 8, Article I, United States Constitution, is limited to federal regulation of actual commerce between the states and among foreign nations. Regulation of intrastate commerce is reserved to the states and to the people of the states. The Commerce Clause of the Constitution constrains the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the federal government. (7)  The power delegated to the United States Congress to make all necessary and proper federal laws under Section 8, Article I, United States Constitution, allows Congress to enact only those laws necessary and proper to execute the constitutionally delegated powers vested in the federal government, all other powers being reserved to the states and to the people of the states. (8)  The power delegated to the United States Congress to provide for the general welfare of the United States under Section 8, Article I, United States Constitution, in the General Welfare Clause constitutionally constrains Congress when exercising a delegated power to act in a manner that serves the states and the people of the states well and uniformly. (9)  Sections 1 and 2, Article I, Texas Constitution, provide that this state and the people of this state retain the sovereign power to regulate the affairs of Texas, subject only to the United States Constitution. (c)  The federal government does not have the power to take any legislative, executive, or judicial action that violates the United States Constitution. (d)  The contract with the State of Texas has been wilfully violated by the federal government and must be constitutionally restored. (e)  This Act calls on all officials in federal, state, and local government, in all branches and at all levels, to honor their oaths to preserve, protect, and defend the United States Constitution and its ratified amendments against any federal action that: (1)  would unconstitutionally undermine, diminish, or disregard the balance of powers between the sovereign states and the federal government established by the United States Constitution and its ratified amendments; or (2)  is outside the scope of the power delegated to the federal government by the United States Constitution. SECTION 2.  Subtitle Z, Title 3, Government Code, is amended by adding Chapter 394 to read as follows: CHAPTER 394.  ENFORCEMENT OF UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION Sec. 394.001.  DEFINITIONS.

(b)  Each house of the legislature shall vote on whether the federal action is an unconstitutional federal action.  If a majority of the members of each house determine that the federal action is an unconstitutional federal action, the determination shall be sent to the governor for approval or disapproval as provided by Section 14, Article IV, Texas Constitution, regarding bills. (c)  A federal action is declared by the state to be an unconstitutional federal action on the day: (1)  the governor approves the vote of the legislature making the determination; or (2)  the determination would become law if presented to the governor as a bill and not objected to by the governor.
