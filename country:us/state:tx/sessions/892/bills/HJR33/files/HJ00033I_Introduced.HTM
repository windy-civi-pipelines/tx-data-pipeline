The Supreme Court of Texas shall have jurisdiction to compel the commission [such Board] to perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of this section by writ of mandamus or other extraordinary writs conformable to the usages of law. The Legislature shall provide necessary funds for clerical and technical aid and for other expenses incidental to the work of the commission for the purposes of this section [Board], and the Lieutenant Governor and the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall be entitled to receive per diem and travel expense during the commission's [Board's] session in the same manner and amount as they would receive while attending a special session of the Legislature.

Sec. 10101 et seq.); (4)  all districts must be geographically contiguous; (5)  the geographic integrity of each municipality, county, local neighborhood, and local community of interest must be respected in a manner that minimizes its division to the extent possible without violating the requirements of any of the preceding subdivisions of this subsection; and (6)  to the extent practicable and to the extent that compliance with this subdivision does not preclude compliance with any of the preceding subdivisions of this subsection, districts must be drawn to encourage geographical compactness so that nearby areas of population are not bypassed for more distant population. (k)  For purposes of Subsection (j)(5) of this section, a community of interest is a contiguous population that shares common social and economic interests that should be included within a single district for purposes of that population's effective and fair representation. Examples of shared social and economic interests are those interests common to an urban area, a rural area, an industrial area, or an agricultural area and those interests common to areas in which the people share similar living standards, use the same transportation facilities, have similar work opportunities, or have access to the same media of communication relevant to the election process. Communities of interest may not be determined based on relationships with political parties, incumbents, or political candidates. (l)  The place of residence of any incumbent or political candidate may not be considered in the creation of a map. Districts may not be drawn for the purpose of favoring or discriminating against an incumbent, political candidate, or political party.

On approval of the special masters' map, the Texas Supreme Court shall certify the map to the secretary of state and the map constitutes the certified final map for the districts included in the map. (q)  The boundary lines of the districts contained in a certified final map apply beginning with the next statewide general election and any corresponding primary elections. (r)  The legislature shall appropriate to the state auditor and the commission amounts sufficient to implement the redistricting process required by this section, Sections 28a and 28c of this article, and general law. The amounts appropriated must provide adequate funding for a statewide outreach program to solicit broad public participation in the redistricting process, including the solicitation of applicants for commission membership, and provide adequate funding for office and meeting space for the commission's operations. (s)  Consistent with this section and Sections 28a and 28c of this article, the legislature by general law shall provide procedures for selecting the members of the commission and may provide provisions governing the powers, duties, and operations of the commission. After enactment, the legislature may not subsequently amend that general law unless: (1)  by the same vote required for the adoption of a final map, the commission recommends amendment of that general law to carry out the purpose and intent of this section and Sections 28a and 28c of this article; (2)  the bill to enact the amendment is approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of all the members elected to each house of the legislature and becomes law in a manner described by Section 14, Article IV, of this constitution; (3)  the bill to enact the amendment is printed and distributed in each house of the legislature at least 12 days before final passage by the legislature; (4)  the amendment furthers the purposes of this section and Sections 28a and 28c of this article; and (5)  the amendment is passed by the legislature in a year not ending in the numeral 9, 0, or 1. Sec. 28c.  (a) The Texas Redistricting Commission has sole standing to defend a legal challenge to a final map certified under Section 28b of this article. The legislature shall provide adequate funding and other resources to the commission to defend a certified final map. The attorney general shall, at the commission's request, represent the commission in defense of a certified final map. The commission may, in its sole discretion, retain legal counsel other than the attorney general to represent the commission in defense of a certified final map. (b)  The Texas Supreme Court has original and exclusive jurisdiction in all proceedings in which a certified final map is challenged or is claimed not to have taken timely effect. (c)  Any registered voter in this state may file a petition for a writ of mandamus or writ of prohibition, not later than the 45th day after a final map is certified to the secretary of state, to bar the secretary of state from implementing the map on the grounds that the map violates this constitution, the United States Constitution, or any federal or state statute. (d)  The Texas Supreme Court shall give priority to ruling on a petition for a writ of mandamus or a writ of prohibition filed under Subsection (c) of this section. If the supreme court determines that a final certified map violates this constitution, the United States Constitution, or any federal or state statute, the court shall fashion the relief that the court deems appropriate, including the relief described by Section 28b(p) of this article. SECTION 3.  Sections 7a(e) and (i), Article V, Texas Constitution, are amended to read as follows: (e)  Unless the legislature enacts a statewide reapportionment of the judicial districts following each federal decennial census, the board shall convene not later than the first Monday of June of the third year following the year in which the federal decennial census is taken to make a statewide reapportionment of the districts. The board shall complete its work on the reapportionment and file its order with the secretary of state not later than August 31 of the same year.

(i)  The legislature, the Judicial Districts Board, or the Texas [Legislative] Redistricting Commission [Board] may not redistrict the judicial districts to provide for any judicial district smaller in size than an entire county except as provided by this section. Judicial districts smaller in size than the entire county may be created subsequent to a general election where a majority of the persons voting on the proposition adopt the proposition "to allow the division of ____________ County into judicial districts composed of parts of ____________ County." No redistricting plan may be proposed or adopted by the legislature, the Judicial Districts Board, or the Texas [Legislative] Redistricting Commission [Board] in anticipation of a future action by the voters of any county.
