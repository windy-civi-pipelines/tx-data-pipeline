Section 1:
89(2) HCR 10 - Introduced version - Bill Text 89S20338 TBO-D By: Raymond H.C.R. No. 10 CONCURRENT RESOLUTION WHEREAS, Year after year, the federal government has failed to make fiscally responsible choices, and Washington must now take aggressive steps to address our serious national deficit; and WHEREAS, The United States Congress routinely passes budgets leading the government to spend more than it receives in revenue; in order to finance the resulting budget deficit, the U.S. Treasury must sell bonds and the government must pay interest on those bonds; this cycle of deficit spending leaves less money for new programs or tax cuts, and it could prove detrimental to the future stability of our nation; and WHEREAS, In the past, such statutory restraints as the failed Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation and "PAYGO" rules have proven ineffective and unenforceable, since simple majorities in Congress can alter, weaken, or dismantle fiscal reforms; an amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which requires the assent of two-thirds of Congress and three-quarters of the states, is the only means of guaranteeing permanent enforcement of spending restraints; and WHEREAS, A federal balanced budget amendment will ensure that Congress uses taxpayer dollars wisely, and it is vital that we take this step to avert fiscal calamity and to eliminate future deficits; now, therefore, be it RESOLVED, That the 89th Legislature of the State of Texas, 2nd Called Session, hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to propose and submit to the states for ratification an amendment to the United States Constitution providing for a balanced federal budget; and, be it further RESOLVED, That the Texas secretary of state forward official copies of this resolution to the president of the United States, to the president of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to Congress with the request that this resolution be officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial to the Congress of the United States of America.
