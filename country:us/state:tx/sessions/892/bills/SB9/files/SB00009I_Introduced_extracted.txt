(q)  The agency shall approve a list of alternative norm-referenced assessment instruments that meet the requirements of this subchapter and that a school district or open-enrollment charter school may administer in place of a beginning-of-year or middle-of-year assessment instrument adopted or developed under this section.  The agency shall: (1)  ensure the list approved under this subsection includes multiple alternative assessment instruments; and (2)  adopt a process by which a school district or open-enrollment charter school may submit to the agency an assessment instrument to be included on the list approved under this subsection. SECTION 1.005.  Subchapter B, Chapter 39, Education Code, is amended by adding Section 39.02301 to read as follows: Sec. 39.02301.  ADOPTION OR DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATION REQUIREMENTS FOR ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS.  (a)  An assessment instrument adopted or developed under Section 39.023 must: (1)  measure student performance in relation to the essential knowledge and skills adopted by the State Board of Education under Section 28.002 for the subject area and grade level being assessed; (2)  include items that have been evaluated for readability using research-based readability metrics approved by the agency in consultation with the advisory committees established under Section 39.02302; (3)  meet industry standards of validity and reliability; (4)  comply with applicable requirements under federal law, including peer review requirements; and (5)  be designed to report student academic growth, including by: (A)  reporting a student's norm-referenced growth based on a comparison of the student's performance on the assessment instrument to the student's performance on a previously administered assessment instrument, as applicable, to measure through-year growth; (B)  for an end-of-year or end-of-course assessment instrument, reporting year-over-year growth in student achievement; and (C)  for a beginning-of-year or middle-of-year assessment instrument, being adaptive to each student to measure and report individual student growth. (b)  Before an assessment instrument adopted or developed under Section 39.023(a) may be administered under that subsection, the assessment instrument must, on the basis of empirical evidence, be determined to be valid and reliable by the advisory committees established under Section 39.02302 or an entity that is, as determined by the commissioner, independent of the agency and of any other entity that developed the assessment instrument. (c)  Before an item may be included on an assessment instrument administered under Section 39.023 that was developed by the agency, the item must be reviewed and approved by a committee composed of teachers in this state. The agency shall form each committee by inviting a total of approximately 40 teachers representing each region of this state who teach the grade level and subject area assessed by the items under review to participate in the committee. For each proposed item, at least three-quarters of participating committee members must agree that: (1)  the item is aligned with the essential knowledge and skills adopted by the State Board of Education under Section 28.002 for the applicable grade level and subject area; (2)  the item is appropriate for the grade level and subject area being assessed and is written at an appropriate reading level for the grade level being assessed; (3)  the item is free from bias and factual error; and (4)  students in the member's classroom would have an opportunity to learn the content included in the item before the administration of the applicable end-of-year or end-of-course assessment instrument. (d)  The writing portion of a reading language arts assessment instrument adopted or developed under Section 39.023 must be designed to assess writing using open-ended questions that are: (1)  grade-level appropriate; (2)  administered separately; and (3)  scored using a process that: (A)  involves classroom teachers in setting grading standards; and (B)  allows for a school district or open-enrollment charter school to submit student responses for rescoring. (e)  For an end-of-year or end-of-course assessment instrument adopted or developed under Section 39.023, the agency shall adopt or develop criterion-referenced assessment instruments designed to assess and report student performance for, at minimum, each performance standard under Section 39.0241. (f)  In setting performance levels for a criterion-referenced assessment instrument adopted or developed under Subsection (e), the commissioner shall implement procedures to maintain the validity and reliability of the assessment instrument, including procedures for field testing items approved by the teacher committees described by Subsection (c).  Except as necessary to comply with college readiness recommendations made by the commissioner of higher education under Section 39.0241(a-1), the commissioner shall ensure the performance levels are set at levels consistent with performance levels set for previous school years, including by implementing procedures that equate the performance levels or by conducting standards-setting processes. (g)  On or before September 1 of each year, the commissioner shall make the following information available on the agency's Internet website for each criterion-referenced assessment instrument administered under Section 39.023(a), (c), or (l): (1)  the number of questions on the assessment instrument; (2)  the number of questions that must be answered correctly to achieve satisfactory performance as determined by the commissioner under Section 39.0241(a); (3)  the number of questions that must be answered correctly to achieve satisfactory performance under the college readiness performance standard as provided by Section 39.0241; and (4)  the corresponding scale scores. (h)  An assessment instrument adopted or developed under Section 39.023 must be designed to support accommodations for students in a special education program under Subchapter A, Chapter 29.  If a student is in a special education program under Subchapter A, Chapter 29, the student's admission, review, and dismissal committee shall determine whether any allowable accommodation is necessary in administering to the student an assessment instrument required under Section 39.023. (i)  The agency shall adopt a schedule for the administration of assessment instruments under Section 39.023 for each school year and provide the schedule to each school district and open-enrollment charter school two years before the school year to which the schedule applies.  The schedule must provide for the administration of an assessment instrument within an assessment administration schedule window in the following applicable range: (1)  for a beginning-of-year assessment instrument, between the fourth Monday in August and September 30; (2)  for a middle-of-year assessment instrument, between January 2 and February 21; and (3)  for an end-of-year assessment instrument, between May 1 and May 30, except that the writing portion of an end-of-year reading language arts assessment instrument must be administered between April 1 and April 15. (j)  An assessment instrument administered under Section 39.023 may be administered in multiple parts over more than one day. The agency shall adopt procedures to reduce total administration time. (k)  An assessment instrument adopted or developed under Section 39.023 must be designed to minimize the impact on student instructional time so that: (1)  for each beginning-of-year or middle-of-year assessment instrument separately administered to students in grades three and four, 85 percent of students who do not require accommodations are expected to complete the assessment instrument within 60 minutes; (2)  for each beginning-of-year or middle-of-year assessment instrument separately administered to students in grades five through eight, 85 percent of students who do not require accommodations are expected to complete the assessment instrument within 75 minutes; (3)  for each end-of-year assessment instrument separately administered to students in grades three and four, 85 percent of students who do not require accommodations are expected to complete the assessment instrument within 90 minutes; and (4)  for each end-of-year assessment instrument separately administered to students in grades five through eight, 85 percent of students who do not require accommodations are expected to complete the assessment instrument within 105 minutes. (l)  The agency shall notify school districts and campuses of the results of assessment instruments administered under Section 39.023 not later than two business days after the date the applicable administration schedule window under Subsection (i) closes. The results should include a diagnostic report for each student and recommendations for use by teachers and parents for practical and useful instructional strategies to better meet the individual needs of the student based on the student's performance on the assessment instrument. (m)  At least every third year, the agency shall release the questions and answer keys to each end-of-year and end-of-course assessment instrument administered under Section 39.023, excluding any assessment instrument administered to a student for the purpose of retaking the assessment instrument or a question on an assessment instrument that will be reused for other assessment instruments, after the last time the instrument is administered for that school year. To ensure a valid bank of questions for use each year, the agency is not required to release a question that is being field-tested and was not used to compute the student's score on the instrument. The agency may defer releasing questions and answer keys as required by this subsection to the extent necessary to develop additional assessment instruments.

In addition to the overall performance rating, each school year, the commissioner shall assign each district and campus a separate domain performance rating of A, B, C, D, or F for each domain under Section 39.053(c). An overall or domain performance rating of A reflects exemplary performance. An overall or domain performance rating of B reflects recognized performance. An overall or domain performance rating of C reflects acceptable performance. An overall or domain performance rating of D reflects performance that needs improvement. An overall or domain performance rating of F reflects unacceptable performance. A district may not receive an overall or domain performance rating of A if the district includes any campus with a corresponding overall or domain performance rating of D or F. If a school district has been approved under Section 39.0544 to assign campus performance ratings and the commissioner has not assigned a campus an overall performance rating of D or F, the commissioner shall assign the campus an overall performance rating based on the school district assigned performance rating under Section 39.0544.

(a-4)  Notwithstanding any other law and except as provided by Subsection (a-6), the commissioner may assign a school district or campus an overall performance rating of "Not Rated" if the commissioner determines that the assignment of a performance rating of A, B, C, D, or F would be inappropriate because: (1)  the district or campus is located in an area that is subject to a declaration of a state of disaster under Chapter 418, Government Code, and due to the disaster, performance indicators for the district or campus are difficult to measure or evaluate and would not accurately reflect quality of learning and achievement for the district or campus; (2)  the district or campus has experienced breaches or other failures in data integrity to the extent that accurate analysis of data regarding performance indicators is not possible; (3)  the number of students enrolled in the district or campus is insufficient to accurately evaluate the performance of the district or campus; or (4)  for other reasons outside the control of the district or campus, the performance indicators would not accurately reflect quality of learning and achievement for the district or campus. (a-5)  Notwithstanding any other law, an overall performance rating of "Not Rated" is not included in calculating consecutive school years of unacceptable performance ratings and is not considered a break in consecutive school years of unacceptable performance ratings for purposes of any provision of this code.  Any interventions or sanctions to which a school district or campus is subject under Chapter 39A shall continue during a period in which the district or campus is assigned an overall performance rating of "Not Rated." (a-6)  The commissioner may not assign an overall performance rating of "Not Rated" to all school districts or all campuses on a statewide basis. (a-7)  If the agency makes changes to the assessment program under Section 39.022 for assessment instruments administered under this subchapter that require new standards for issuing performance ratings under this section, the agency must conduct a performance comparison analysis between the program as changed and the preceding program to establish roughly comparable standards for issuing performance ratings. (c)  The commissioner shall make the information under Subsection (a-3) available as soon as reasonably possible in years in which the standards are modified or recalibrated or in which a new assessment instrument is offered.

In addition to the overall performance rating, each school year, the commissioner shall assign each district and campus a separate domain performance rating of A, B, C, D, or F for each domain under Section 39.053(c). An overall or domain performance rating of A reflects exemplary performance. An overall or domain performance rating of B reflects recognized performance. An overall or domain performance rating of C reflects acceptable performance. An overall or domain performance rating of D reflects performance that needs improvement. An overall or domain performance rating of F reflects unacceptable performance. A district may not receive an overall or domain performance rating of A if the district includes any campus with a corresponding overall or domain performance rating of D or F. If a school district has been approved under Section 39.0544 to assign campus performance ratings and the commissioner has not assigned a campus an overall performance rating of D or F, the commissioner shall assign the campus an overall performance rating based on the school district assigned performance rating under Section 39.0544.

(a-4)  Notwithstanding any other law and except as provided by Subsection (a-6), the commissioner may assign a school district or campus an overall performance rating of "Not Rated" if the commissioner determines that the assignment of a performance rating of A, B, C, D, or F would be inappropriate because: (1)  the district or campus is located in an area that is subject to a declaration of a state of disaster under Chapter 418, Government Code, and due to the disaster, performance indicators for the district or campus are difficult to measure or evaluate and would not accurately reflect quality of learning and achievement for the district or campus; (2)  the district or campus has experienced breaches or other failures in data integrity to the extent that accurate analysis of data regarding performance indicators is not possible; (3)  the number of students enrolled in the district or campus is insufficient to accurately evaluate the performance of the district or campus; or (4)  for other reasons outside the control of the district or campus, the performance indicators would not accurately reflect quality of learning and achievement for the district or campus. (a-5)  Notwithstanding any other law, an overall performance rating of "Not Rated" is not included in calculating consecutive school years of unacceptable performance ratings and is not considered a break in consecutive school years of unacceptable performance ratings for purposes of any provision of this code.  Any interventions or sanctions to which a school district or campus is subject under Chapter 39A shall continue during a period in which the district or campus is assigned an overall performance rating of "Not Rated." (a-6)  The commissioner may not assign an overall performance rating of "Not Rated" to all school districts or all campuses on a statewide basis. (a-7)  If the agency makes changes to the assessment program under Section 39.022 for assessment instruments administered under this subchapter that require new standards for issuing performance ratings under this section, the agency must conduct a performance comparison analysis between the program as changed and the preceding program to establish roughly comparable standards for issuing performance ratings. (c)  The commissioner shall make the information under Subsection (a-3) available as soon as reasonably possible in years in which the standards are modified or recalibrated or in which a new assessment instrument is offered.
