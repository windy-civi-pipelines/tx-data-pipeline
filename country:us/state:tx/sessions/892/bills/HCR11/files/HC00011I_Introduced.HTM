Section 1:
89(2) HCR 11 - Introduced version - Bill Text 89S20516 KSM-D By: Lopez of Cameron H.C.R. No. 11 CONCURRENT RESOLUTION WHEREAS, Flood mitigation projects across Texas have been hindered by lengthy delays in the approval of funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; and WHEREAS, An application to FEMA's Flood Mitigation Assistance grant program was submitted for the Combes Lateral Drainage Improvement project in February 2024; FEMA issued a notice of selection for funding, and the Texas Water Development Board proceeded to address all pre-award items by November 2024; however, despite meeting the requirements thus far, the project has not yet received final approval for funding; most recently, FEMA has submitted the application to DHS for approval, but the agencies have neglected to provide a timeline for the completion of that process; and WHEREAS, Another Flood Mitigation Assistance application was submitted for the North Main Drainage Improvement project in April 2025, yet over the past three months, FEMA has failed to issue a notice of funding selections or even offer an expected timeline for a decision; and WHEREAS, While these projects are largely focused on drainage infrastructure, they reflect the broader challenges that Texas communities face in accessing timely and reliable support from federal agencies; obstacles to funding prevent the completion of projects that would protect the lives and property of residents, especially those who live in flood-prone areas; and WHEREAS, Delays in the approval of funding from FEMA and DHS have left countless citizens vulnerable to life-threatening and destructive floods, and the federal government must take immediate action to avoid further harm; now, therefore, be it RESOLVED, That the 89th Legislature of the State of Texas, 2nd Called Session, hereby respectfully urge the Department of Homeland Security to expedite the approval of all Federal Emergency Management Agency applications for flood mitigation projects in Texas; and, be it further RESOLVED, That the Texas secretary of state forward official copies of this resolution to the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and to the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
