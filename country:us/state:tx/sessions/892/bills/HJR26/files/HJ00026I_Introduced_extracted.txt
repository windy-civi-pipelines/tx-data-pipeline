On approval of the special masters' map, the Texas Supreme Court shall certify the map to the secretary of state and the map constitutes the certified final map for the districts included in the map. (p)  The boundary lines of the districts contained in a certified final map apply beginning with the next statewide general election and any corresponding primary elections. (q)  The governor shall present to the legislature an estimate of the amount of money required for the purposes of this section and Sections 28a and 28c of this article.  The legislature shall appropriate to the state auditor, the secretary of state, and the commission amounts sufficient to implement the redistricting process required by this section, Sections 28a and 28c of this article, and general law.

Sec. 28c.  (a) The Independent Citizen Redistricting Commission has sole standing to defend a legal challenge to a final map certified under Section 28b of this article. The legislature shall provide adequate funding and other resources to the commission to defend a certified final map. The attorney general shall, at the commission's request, represent the commission in defense of a certified final map. The commission may, in its sole discretion, retain legal counsel other than the attorney general to represent the commission in defense of a certified final map. (b)  Any registered voter in this state may file a petition for a writ of mandamus or writ of prohibition, not later than the 45th day after a final map is certified to the secretary of state, to bar the secretary of state from implementing the map on the grounds that the map violates this constitution, the United States Constitution, or any federal or state statute. (c)  If the court determines that a final certified map violates this constitution, the United States Constitution, or any federal or state statute, the court shall fashion the relief that the court deems appropriate, including the relief described by Section 28b(o) of this article.
