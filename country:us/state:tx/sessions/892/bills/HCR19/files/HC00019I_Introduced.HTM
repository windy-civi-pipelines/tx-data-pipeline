89(2) HCR 19 - Introduced version - Bill Text 89S20625 TBO-D By: Flores H.C.R. No. 19 CONCURRENT RESOLUTION WHEREAS, In recent months, federal immigration enforcement agents have increasingly worn masks and other attire to conceal their identities while they conduct public-facing enforcement actions; and WHEREAS, Without visible badges, names, or insignia, members of the public are unable to confirm whether they are interacting with legitimate government officials; this lack of transparency causes confusion and fear while eroding trust in law enforcement, which culminates in high-stress situations that endanger both civilians and law enforcement personnel; in addition, when federal agents fail to properly identify themselves, they create obstacles to accountability and prevent those who are detained from challenging unlawful conduct in court; and WHEREAS, A number of public officials have voiced concern that allowing federal agents to conceal their identities would provide bad actors with more opportunities to impersonate law enforcement personnel and use their anonymity to enact violence; even before the use of masks became commonplace, there was a rise in crimes perpetrated by individuals impersonating law enforcement, including harassment, theft, extortion, assault, battery, sexual assault, and kidnapping; recently, two Minnesota state legislators and their spouses were murdered by an individual who was disguised as a police officer; and WHEREAS, Several incidents involving masked and plainclothes federal agents have created complications for local law enforcement; for example, in June 2025, masked and armed agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection operated a caravan of unmarked vehicles and attempted to enter the parking lots of Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California; after the agents were denied entry by the stadium's security, police officers were called to the scene and the group of federal agents dispersed; the event sparked a wave of speculation and misinformation online, and local officials were left with the burden of finding answers to the onslaught of questions from the public; and WHEREAS, Federal immigration enforcement agencies have yet to issue official policies governing the use of masks by agents or provide a clear justification for allowing agents to conceal their identities; however, some members of the U.S. Congress have introduced legislation to remedy those lax uniform policies; the Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement (VISIBLE) Act would require immigration enforcement officers to display clearly visible identification during public-facing enforcement actions; the No Secret Police Act would require law enforcement officers and agents of the Department of Homeland Security to clearly display identification and insignia when detaining or arresting individuals, and the bill would also ban the officers from using home-made, non-tactical masks; the No Anonymity in Immigration Enforcement Act would prohibit U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from wearing facial coverings while conducting immigration enforcement operations; and WHEREAS, In order to maintain the public's trust and foster healthy relationships with the communities they serve, law enforcement officers, including federal agents, must prioritize transparency and accountability, and the concealment of their identities is antithetical to those values; now, therefore, be it RESOLVED, That the 89th Legislature of the State of Texas, 2nd Called Session, hereby respectfully urge the United States Congress to pass legislation requiring federal agents who are conducting arrests to wear proper uniforms and present identification and prohibiting agents from wearing facial coverings during public-facing enforcement actions; and, be it further RESOLVED, That the Texas secretary of state forward official copies of this resolution to the president of the United States, to the president of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to Congress with the request that this resolution be entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial to the Congress of the United States of America.
