SECTION 4.  Section 24.946(a), Government Code, is amended to read as follows: (a)  The board shall meet in accordance with its own rules. The board shall meet at least once in each interim between regular sessions of the legislature and shall exercise its reapportionment powers only in the interims between regular legislative sessions. Meetings of the board shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 551, except as otherwise provided by this subchapter. A reapportionment may not be ordered in the interim immediately following a regular session of the legislature in which a valid and subsisting statewide reapportionment of judicial districts is enacted by the legislature. Unless the legislature enacts a statewide reapportionment of the judicial districts following each federal decennial census, the board shall convene not later than the first Monday of June of the third year following the year in which the federal decennial census is taken to make a statewide reapportionment of the districts. The board shall complete its work on the reapportionment and file its order with the secretary of state not later than August 31 of the same year.

SECTION 7.  This Act takes effect September 1, 2029, but only if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 89th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2025, to establish the Independent Citizen Redistricting Commission to redistrict the Texas Legislature, Texas congressional districts, and State Board of Education districts and revising procedures for redistricting is approved by the voters.  If that proposed constitutional amendment is not approved by the voters, this Act has no effect.

SECTION 3.  Section 42.032, Election Code, is amended to read as follows: Sec. 42.032.  REDISTRICTING: BOUNDARY CHANGES. If changes in county election precinct boundaries are necessary to give effect to a redistricting plan adopted under Article III, Section 28b [28], of the Texas Constitution, each commissioners court shall order the changes before October 1 of the year in which the redistricting is done. SECTION 4.  Section 24.946(a), Government Code, is amended to read as follows: (a)  The board shall meet in accordance with its own rules. The board shall meet at least once in each interim between regular sessions of the legislature and shall exercise its reapportionment powers only in the interims between regular legislative sessions. Meetings of the board shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 551, except as otherwise provided by this subchapter. A reapportionment may not be ordered in the interim immediately following a regular session of the legislature in which a valid and subsisting statewide reapportionment of judicial districts is enacted by the legislature. Unless the legislature enacts a statewide reapportionment of the judicial districts following each federal decennial census, the board shall convene not later than the first Monday of June of the third year following the year in which the federal decennial census is taken to make a statewide reapportionment of the districts. The board shall complete its work on the reapportionment and file its order with the secretary of state not later than August 31 of the same year. If the Judicial Districts Board fails to make a statewide apportionment by that date, the Independent Citizen [Legislative] Redistricting Commission [Board] established by Article III, Section 28b [28], of the Texas Constitution shall make a statewide reapportionment of the judicial districts not later than the 90th [150th] day after the final day for the Judicial Districts Board to make the reapportionment, and that apportionment takes effect as provided by Sections 24.948 and 24.949. SECTION 5.  Section 2058.002(a), Government Code, is amended to read as follows: (a)  The legislature or the Independent Citizen [Legislative] Redistricting Commission [Board under Article III, Section 28, of the Texas Constitution] may officially recognize or act on a federal decennial census before September 1 of the year after the calendar year during which the census was taken. SECTION 6.  Chapter 581, Government Code, as added by this Act, applies only in relation to a United States decennial census taken on or after January 1, 2030.  The establishment or modification of district boundaries in connection with a United States decennial census taken before that date, including any legal challenge, is governed by the law in effect immediately before the effective date of this Act, and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose. SECTION 7.  This Act takes effect September 1, 2029, but only if the constitutional amendment proposed by the 89th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2025, to establish the Independent Citizen Redistricting Commission to redistrict the Texas Legislature, Texas congressional districts, and State Board of Education districts and revising procedures for redistricting is approved by the voters.  If that proposed constitutional amendment is not approved by the voters, this Act has no effect.
