(b)  An attorney selected by a parent under Subsection (a) must: (1)  be licensed to practice law in this state; (2)  be in good standing with the State Bar of Texas; and (3)  meet the applicable continuing education requirements of Section 107.0131. (c)  The selection of an attorney by a parent under Subsection (a) is independent of any appointment system implemented by the court, including the rotation system described by Section 37.004, Government Code.

(d)  An attorney selected by a parent under Subsection (a) shall serve as the parent's counsel of record upon filing with the court a notice of appearance and, if the parent is represented by other counsel, a motion to substitute counsel with the court. The filing of the notice and, if applicable, the motion is a ministerial act and does not require the approval of the court. The court's review of a notice and motion filed under this subsection shall be limited to confirming the attorney meets the requirements of Subsection (b). Upon confirming an attorney selected by a parent under Subsection (a) meets the requirements of Subsection (b), the court shall: (1)  grant the attorney's motion to substitute counsel, if applicable; and (2)  terminate the appointment of any previously appointed attorney ad litem for the parent.

(h)  A court may not adopt or enforce local rules that conflict with this section, impose additional requirements on the selection of an attorney under this section, or otherwise interfere with the right of a parent to select an attorney under Subsection (a). Interference with the selection of an attorney by a parent under Subsection (a) for financial gain or favoritism is a violation of judicial ethics and may subject a judge to discipline under the Code of Judicial Conduct or prosecution under the penal laws of this state, including Section 36.02 or 36.08, Penal Code, as applicable. (i)  This section does not limit the authority of a court to remove an attorney for good cause under applicable law. (j)  The Office of Court Administration of the Texas Judicial System may adopt rules necessary to implement this section.
