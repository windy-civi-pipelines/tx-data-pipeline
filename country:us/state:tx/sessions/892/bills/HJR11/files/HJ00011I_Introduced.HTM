BE IT RESOLVED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS: SECTION 1.  Article VIII, Texas Constitution, is amended by adding Section 22A to read as follows: Sec. 22.  (a)  For purposes of this section, "all funds appropriations" means appropriations from: (1)  the general revenue fund in the state or local treasury; (2)  a dedicated account in the general revenue fund in the state or local treasury; (3)  a general revenue-related fund in the state treasury as identified in the biennial statement required of the comptroller under Section 49a, Article III, Texas Constitution; and (4)  the other state funds, other local funds, and federal funds in the state or local treasury.

(b)  The Legislative Budget Board shall approve the calculated rate using the available data and adopt the applicable limit prior to the commencement of each regular state legislative session and each local government shall use this determined rate. (c)  The state legislature or local entity may exceed the limit imposed by this section only if: 1.  Three-fourths of the members of each house of the state legislature for the state budget and three-fourths of the members of each local entity approve a resolution specifying the amount of appropriations authorized above the limit and identifying the nature of the emergency. (d)  Any over-collected taxpayer money will be returned to them by reducing tax rates as determined by the state for the state budget or local entity for the local entity's budget. SECTION 2.  This proposed constitutional amendment shall be submitted to the voters at an election to be held November 4, 2025. The ballot shall be printed to permit voting for or against the proposition: "The constitutional amendment concerning the limitation on the rate of growth in state and local appropriations, and any over-collected taxpayer money will be returned by lowering taxes." SECTION 3.  This Act takes effect on the date on which the constitutional amendment proposed by the 89th Legislature, Regular Session, 2025, authorizing an appropriations limitation on state and local governments in Texas. If that amendment is not approved by the voters, this Act has no effect.
