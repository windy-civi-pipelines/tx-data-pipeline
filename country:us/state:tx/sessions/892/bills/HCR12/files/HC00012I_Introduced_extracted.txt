Section 1:
89(2) HCR 12 - Introduced version - Bill Text By: González of Dallas H.C.R. No. 12 HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION WHEREAS, Prior to the 2024 presidential election, many public figures now holding high office in the executive branch called for the release of Federal Bureau of Investigation files on deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein; and WHEREAS, Current FBI Director Kash Patel, Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi, and Vice President J. D. Vance were among the many who have long sought the release of files from the FBI investigation of Mr. Epstein; he was federally charged in 2019 with sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors in a case involving dozens of victims; later that year, he died in custody while awaiting trial; his associate and confidante, Ghislaine Maxwell, was subsequently convicted on federal charges related to her role in recruiting and grooming underage girls on his behalf; and WHEREAS, In 2008, Mr. Epstein had pleaded guilty in Florida to state charges of soliciting prostitution and soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18; his light sentence caused a scandal when The Miami Herald revealed that despite reams of evidence against him, he had secured a non-prosecution agreement from the office of then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, who was later appointed U.S. secretary of labor by President Donald J. Trump; Mr. Acosta resigned from the cabinet when the federal indictment against Mr. Epstein was unsealed; and WHEREAS, Since President Trump returned to the White House in January 2025, he and senior members of his administration have repeatedly stated that the government would release a full accounting of the Epstein case, including names of associates, thousands of pages of evidence, and potential criminal referrals; in February, after indicating to Fox News that she had on her desk a long-rumored list of Mr. Epstein's clients, Attorney General Bondi distributed binders of "declassified" records that proved to be nothing more than a collection of already public information; in response to the resulting furor, she ordered a comprehensive report from the FBI director; according to media accounts, the New York field office then delayed other investigations in order for hundreds of FBI agents to work around the clock reviewing the Epstein files; nevertheless, no more information was forthcoming, and on July 7, the Justice Department abruptly posted a memo asserting that the much-anticipated "client list" did not exist and the agency did not intend to release any new information on the matter; and WHEREAS, The Trump administration has purported to be the most transparent in the history of the country, but officials who once clamored for the release of the Epstein files are now asserting they contain nothing of interest; today, there are more questions than ever about Mr. Epstein's criminal activity and his associates, and the ongoing lack of candor is causing the American public to question the honesty and integrity of the administration; now, therefore, be it RESOLVED, That the 89th Legislature of the State of Texas, 2nd Called Session, hereby call for the U.S. Department of Justice and the Trump administration to release the complete Epstein files; and, be it further RESOLVED, That the Texas secretary of state forward official copies of this resolution to President Donald Trump and to U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi.
