(d)  Except as provided by Subsection (e), the board shall determine for the next state fiscal biennium a limit on the amount of: (1)  state fund appropriations from all revenues by multiplying the amount of all fund appropriations from all tax revenues for the current state fiscal biennium by the sum of one and the limit on the rate of growth of appropriations from all tax revenues established by the board under Subsection (a)(1); and (e)  If the rate determined under Subsection (a)(2) is a negative number, the amount of state funds appropriations for the next state fiscal biennium may not exceed the amount of state funds appropriations in the current state fiscal biennium nor could a political subdivision.

Sec. 316.006.  LIMIT ON BUDGET RECOMMENDATIONS. Unless authorized by majority vote of the members of the board from each house, the Legislative Budget Board budget recommendations: (1)  relating to the proposed appropriations from [of] state tax revenues not dedicated by the constitution may not exceed the limit on appropriations from those sources adopted by the committee under Section 316.005; and (2)  relating to the proposed state funds appropriations may not exceed the limit on appropriations from those sources adopted by the committee under Section 316.005.

The resolution must find that an emergency exists, identify the nature of the emergency, and specify the amount authorized.  The excess amount authorized under this subsection may not exceed the amount specified in the resolution.
