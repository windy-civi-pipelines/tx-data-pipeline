89(2) HCR 13 - Engrossed version - Bill Text 89S20775 KSM-D By: Guillen, Kitzman, McLaughlin, Holt, Cook, H.C.R. No. 13 et al. HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION WHEREAS, The New World screwworm, a parasitic fly that infests livestock and other warm-blooded animals, poses a serious threat to our livestock industry, food supply chain, and economy; and WHEREAS, A species endemic to Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and parts of South America, Cochliomyia hominivorax resembles a common housefly in its mature form; infestations occur when the female fly deposits eggs on an animal's open wound or other vulnerable area; the emerging larvae burrow and feed on the surrounding tissue, causing serious injury and often death to the host; left untreated, a screwworm infection can kill an animal within two weeks and continue to spread to additional hosts; and WHEREAS, The United States battled screwworm infestations from at least the 1800s until the 1960s, when the pest was officially eradicated through the widespread release of sterilized flies into wild populations; however, the species has seen a resurgence in recent years, and its presence around 700 miles from the Texas border prompted the federal government to halt cattle imports from Mexico in May 2025; as of July 2025, it was only 370 miles from the Texas border; and WHEREAS, The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that Texas could suffer $1.8 billion in economic damage from a screwworm outbreak through livestock deaths, labor costs, and medication expenses; the consequences of such an event could ripple nationwide, straining the U.S. cattle supply and endangering the health of livestock as well as pets, wildlife, and even people; and WHEREAS, With experts sounding the alarm over the imminent arrival of the New World screwworm, federal intervention is urgently needed to protect Texas ranchers and minimize economic losses from this destructive parasite; now, therefore, be it RESOLVED, That the 89th Legislature of the State of Texas, 2nd Called Session, hereby respectfully urge the federal government to take immediate action to curb the spread of the New World screwworm into Texas, including using existing resources to work with Mexico to further develop a plan to combat screwworms; and, be it further RESOLVED, That the Texas Legislature hereby respectfully urge the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to expedite the construction of the planned screwworm control facility at Moore Air Force Base in Texas; and, be it further RESOLVED, That the Texas Legislature hereby respectfully urge the USDA to partner with Texas A&M AgriLife to create space in the new screwworm control facility for research purposes; and, be it further RESOLVED, That the Texas Legislature hereby respectfully urge the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to expeditiously approve medications for treating screwworm infection; and, be it further RESOLVED, That the Texas Legislature hereby respectfully urge the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to expeditiously approve pesticides for preventing and treating screwworm infection; and, be it further RESOLVED, That the Texas secretary of state forward official copies of this resolution to the president of the United States, to the secretary of the USDA, to the commissioner of the FDA, to the administrator of the EPA, to the president of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to Congress with the request that this resolution be entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial to the Congress of the United States of America.
