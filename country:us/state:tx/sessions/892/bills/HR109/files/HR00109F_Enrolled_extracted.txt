Lutheran Music Academy; and WHEREAS, Generations of Texans have looked to First Lutheran Church of Galveston for guidance, inspiration, and hope over the course of its long history, and it is a pleasure to recognize the abiding faith and commitment of those who have sustained the church across three centuries; now, therefore, be it RESOLVED, That the House of Representatives of the 89th Texas Legislature, 2nd Called Session, hereby commemorate the 175th anniversary of First Lutheran Church of Galveston and extend to the congregation sincere best wishes for many more years of shared prayer and fellowship; and, be it further RESOLVED, That an official copy of this resolution be prepared for the church as an expression of high regard by the Texas House of Representatives.
