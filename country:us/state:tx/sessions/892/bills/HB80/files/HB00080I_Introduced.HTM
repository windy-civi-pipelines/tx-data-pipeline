Section 1:
89(2) HB 80 - Introduced version - Bill Text By: Toth H.B. No. 80 A BILL TO BE ENTITLED AN ACT relating to abortion, including civil liability for distribution of abortion-inducing drugs and duties of Internet service providers; creating a criminal offense; authorizing a private civil right of action. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS: SECTION 1.  This Act shall be known as the Women and Child Safety Act. SECTION 2.  The legislature finds that: (1)  human life begins at fertilization; (2)  abortion is a murderous act of violence that purposefully and knowingly terminates a human life in the womb; (3)  unborn human beings are entitled to the full and equal protection of the laws that prohibit violence against other human beings; (4)  the United States Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, No. 19-1392 (U.S. June 24, 2022), correctly overruled the lawless and unconstitutional pronouncements in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) and Planned Parenthood of Southern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), which had invented and perpetuated a supposed constitutional right to abortion that cannot be found anywhere in the text of the United States Constitution; (5)  so-called abortion funds that operate in this state have been funding and otherwise aiding or abetting criminal abortions performed in violation of the laws of this state, exposing themselves and each of their donors to felony criminal prosecution; (6)  the abortion funds and their donors are not and never were protected by an injunction in any abortion-related case because they are not parties to those cases, and there has never been an injunction that restrains a state official from prosecuting abortion funds and their donors who aided or abetted abortions performed in violation of the laws of this state; (7)  the abortion funds and their donors are not and never were protected from criminal prosecution by Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), because: (A)  there is no constitutional right to pay for another person's abortion; (B)  abortion funds and their donors lack third-party standing to assert the supposed constitutional rights of women seeking abortions; and (C)  any immunity from prosecution that the abortionist might have enjoyed on account of Roe does not preclude the imposition of accomplice liability on abortion funds and their donors; (8)  it is a federal crime to mail abortion-inducing drugs or to receive them in the mail, punishable by five years imprisonment, under 18 U.S.C. Section 1461; (9)  it is also a federal crime to transport abortion-inducing drugs in interstate or foreign commerce under 18 U.S.C. Section 1462(c); (10)  these federal statutes are fully enforceable now that Roe has been overruled, and the statute of limitations for each of these crimes is five years; (11)  violations of 18 U.S.C. Sections 1461-1462 are predicate offenses under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (18 U.S.C. Section 1961 et seq.), which exposes distribution networks of abortion-inducing drugs and their donors to civil racketeering liability as well as criminal prosecution as a racketeering enterprise under federal law; (12)  the legislature calls on the attorney general and each district attorney in this state to investigate and prosecute abortion funds and each of their donors for aiding or abetting criminal abortion in this state in violation of the laws of this state; and (13)  the legislature calls on state and federal prosecutors in this state to investigate and prosecute every distribution network for abortion-inducing drugs under federal racketeering laws as well as 18 U.S.C. Sections 1461-1462. SECTION 3.  Subtitle H, Title 2, Health and Safety Code, is amended by adding Chapter 171A to read as follows: CHAPTER 171A.

(a) Notwithstanding any other law, a provision of the laws of this state may not be construed to waive or abrogate an immunity conferred by Section 171A.451 unless it expressly waives or abrogates immunity with specific reference to that section.

(a) Notwithstanding any other law, judicial relief issued by a court of this state that disregards the immunity conferred by Section 171A.451 or the jurisdictional limitation described by Section 171A.455: (1)  is considered void because a court without jurisdiction issued the relief; and (2)  may not be enforced or obeyed by an officer, employee, or agent, including a judicial official, of this state or a political subdivision of this state.

Section 1462(c); (21)  a violation of an abortion law under Chapter 170, 170A, 171, or 171A, Health and Safety Code, or Chapter 6-1/2, Title 71, Revised Statutes; and (22)  an offense under Chapter 28 directed at a church, a crisis pregnancy center, an adoption agency, or an entity that offers alternatives to abortion services. SECTION 5.  (a)  Mindful of Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U.S. 137 (1996), in which in the context of determining the severability of a state statute regulating abortion the United States Supreme Court held that an explicit statement of legislative intent is controlling, it is the intent of the legislature that every provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word in this Act, and every application of the provisions in this Act to every person, group of persons, or circumstances, are severable from each other. (b)  If any application of any provision in this Act to any person, group of persons, or circumstances is found by a court to be invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional, for any reason whatsoever, then the remaining applications of that provision to all other persons and circumstances shall be severed and preserved, and shall remain in effect. All constitutionally valid applications of the provisions in this Act shall be severed from any applications that a court finds to be invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional, because it is the legislature's intent and priority that every single valid application of every statutory provision be allowed to stand alone. (c)  The legislature further declares that it would have enacted this Act, and each provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word, and all constitutional applications of the provisions of this Act, irrespective of the fact that any provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word, or applications of this Act were to be declared invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional. (d)  If any provision of this Act is found by any court to be unconstitutionally vague, then the applications of that provision that do not present constitutional vagueness problems shall be severed and remain in force, consistent with the severability requirements of Subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section. (e)  No court may decline to enforce the severability requirements of Subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section on the ground that severance would rewrite the statute or involve the court in legislative or lawmaking activity. A court that declines to enforce or enjoins a state official from enforcing a statutory provision is not rewriting a statute or engaging in legislative or lawmaking activity, as the statute continues to contain the same words as before the court's decision. A judicial injunction or declaration of unconstitutionality: (1)  is nothing more than an edict prohibiting enforcement of the disputed statute against the named parties to that lawsuit, which may subsequently be vacated by a later court if that court has a different understanding of the requirements of the Texas Constitution or United States Constitution; (2)  is not a formal amendment of the language in a statute; and (3)  no more rewrites a statute than a decision by the executive not to enforce a duly enacted statute in a limited and defined set of circumstances. (f)  If any state or federal court disregards any of the severability requirements in Subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, and declares or finds any provision of this Act facially invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional, when there are discrete applications of that provision that can be enforced against a person, a group of persons, or circumstances without violating federal law or the United States Constitution or Texas Constitution, then that provision shall be interpreted, as a matter of state law, as if the legislature had enacted a provision limited to the persons, group of persons, or circumstances for which the provision's application will not violate federal law or the United States Constitution or Texas Constitution, and every court shall adopt this saving construction of that provision until the court ruling that pronounced the provision facially invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional is vacated or overruled. SECTION 6.  Chapter 171A, Health and Safety Code, as added by this Act, applies only to a cause of action that accrues on or after the effective date of this Act. SECTION 7.  Section 71.02, Penal Code, as amended by this Act, applies only to an offense committed on or after the effective date of this Act.  An offense committed before the effective date of this Act is governed by the law in effect on the date the offense was committed, and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  For purposes of this section, an offense was committed before the effective date of this Act if any element of the offense occurred before that date. SECTION 8.  This Act takes effect September 1, 2025.

Raw Text:
89(2) HB 80 - Introduced version - Bill Text By: Toth H.B. No. 80 A BILL TO BE ENTITLED AN ACT relating to abortion, including civil liability for distribution of abortion-inducing drugs and duties of Internet service providers; creating a criminal offense; authorizing a private civil right of action. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS: SECTION 1.  This Act shall be known as the Women and Child Safety Act. SECTION 2.  The legislature finds that: (1)  human life begins at fertilization; (2)  abortion is a murderous act of violence that purposefully and knowingly terminates a human life in the womb; (3)  unborn human beings are entitled to the full and equal protection of the laws that prohibit violence against other human beings; (4)  the United States Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, No. 19-1392 (U.S. June 24, 2022), correctly overruled the lawless and unconstitutional pronouncements in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) and Planned Parenthood of Southern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), which had invented and perpetuated a supposed constitutional right to abortion that cannot be found anywhere in the text of the United States Constitution; (5)  so-called abortion funds that operate in this state have been funding and otherwise aiding or abetting criminal abortions performed in violation of the laws of this state, exposing themselves and each of their donors to felony criminal prosecution; (6)  the abortion funds and their donors are not and never were protected by an injunction in any abortion-related case because they are not parties to those cases, and there has never been an injunction that restrains a state official from prosecuting abortion funds and their donors who aided or abetted abortions performed in violation of the laws of this state; (7)  the abortion funds and their donors are not and never were protected from criminal prosecution by Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), because: (A)  there is no constitutional right to pay for another person's abortion; (B)  abortion funds and their donors lack third-party standing to assert the supposed constitutional rights of women seeking abortions; and (C)  any immunity from prosecution that the abortionist might have enjoyed on account of Roe does not preclude the imposition of accomplice liability on abortion funds and their donors; (8)  it is a federal crime to mail abortion-inducing drugs or to receive them in the mail, punishable by five years imprisonment, under 18 U.S.C. Section 1461; (9)  it is also a federal crime to transport abortion-inducing drugs in interstate or foreign commerce under 18 U.S.C. Section 1462(c); (10)  these federal statutes are fully enforceable now that Roe has been overruled, and the statute of limitations for each of these crimes is five years; (11)  violations of 18 U.S.C. Sections 1461-1462 are predicate offenses under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (18 U.S.C. Section 1961 et seq.), which exposes distribution networks of abortion-inducing drugs and their donors to civil racketeering liability as well as criminal prosecution as a racketeering enterprise under federal law; (12)  the legislature calls on the attorney general and each district attorney in this state to investigate and prosecute abortion funds and each of their donors for aiding or abetting criminal abortion in this state in violation of the laws of this state; and (13)  the legislature calls on state and federal prosecutors in this state to investigate and prosecute every distribution network for abortion-inducing drugs under federal racketeering laws as well as 18 U.S.C. Sections 1461-1462. SECTION 3.  Subtitle H, Title 2, Health and Safety Code, is amended by adding Chapter 171A to read as follows: CHAPTER 171A.

(e)  It is not a defense to an action brought under Subsection (d) that: (1)  a prevailing party under this section failed to seek recovery of costs or attorney's fees in the underlying action; (2)  the court in the underlying action declined to recognize or enforce this section; or (3)  the court in the underlying action held that any provisions of this section are invalid, unconstitutional, or preempted by federal law, notwithstanding the doctrines of issue or claim preclusion. SUBCHAPTER J. IMMUNITY AND LIMITS ON STATE-COURT JURISDICTION Sec. 171A.451.  SOVEREIGN, GOVERNMENTAL, AND OFFICIAL IMMUNITY. (a) Except as provided by Subsection (b) but notwithstanding any other law, the state has sovereign immunity, a political subdivision of this state has governmental immunity, and an officer or employee of this state or a political subdivision of this state has official immunity in an action, claim, counterclaim, or any other type of legal or equitable action that: (1)  challenges the validity of any provision or application of this chapter, on constitutional grounds or otherwise; or (2)  seeks to prevent or enjoin this state, a political subdivision of this state, or an officer or employee of this state or a political subdivision of this state from: (A)  enforcing any provision or application of this chapter; or (B)  hearing, adjudicating, or docketing a civil action brought under Section 171A.101, 171A.151, or 171A.201. (b)  Subsection (a) does not apply to the extent that immunity has been abrogated or preempted by federal law in a manner consistent with the United States Constitution. (c)  Sovereign immunity conferred by this section includes the constitutional sovereign immunity recognized by the United States Supreme Court, which applies in both state and federal court and may not be abrogated by Congress or by a state or federal court except under legislation authorized by: (1)  Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, United States Constitution; (2)  the Bankruptcy Clause of Article I, United States Constitution; or (3)  Congress's powers to raise and support armies and to provide and maintain a navy. Sec. 171A.452.  APPLICABILITY OF IMMUNITY. Notwithstanding any other law, the immunity conferred by Section 171A.451 applies to every court, both state and federal, and in every type of adjudicative proceeding. Sec. 171A.453.  CONSTRUCTION OF CHAPTER. This chapter may not be construed to prevent a litigant from asserting the invalidity or unconstitutionality of a provision or application of this chapter as a defense to an action, claim, or counterclaim brought against the litigant. Sec. 171A.454.  WAIVER OF IMMUNITY. (a) Notwithstanding any other law, a provision of the laws of this state may not be construed to waive or abrogate an immunity conferred by Section 171A.451 unless it expressly waives or abrogates immunity with specific reference to that section. (b)  Notwithstanding any other law, an attorney representing the state, a political subdivision of this state, or an officer or employee of this state or a political subdivision of this state may not waive an immunity conferred by Section 171A.451 or take an action that would result in a waiver of that immunity. A purported waiver or action described by this subsection is considered void and an ultra vires act. Sec. 171A.455.  JURISDICTION. Notwithstanding any other law, a court of this state does not have jurisdiction to consider and may not award relief under any action, claim, or counterclaim that: (1)  seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, or any type of writ, that would pronounce any provision or application of this subchapter invalid or unconstitutional; or (2)  would restrain a person, including this state, a political subdivision of this state, or an officer or employee of this state or a political subdivision of this state, from: (A)  enforcing any provision or application of this chapter; or (B)  hearing, adjudicating, or docketing a civil action brought under Section 171A.101, 171A.151, or 171A.201. Sec. 171A.456.  EFFECT OF CONTRARY JUDICIAL ACTIONS. (a) Notwithstanding any other law, judicial relief issued by a court of this state that disregards the immunity conferred by Section 171A.451 or the jurisdictional limitation described by Section 171A.455: (1)  is considered void because a court without jurisdiction issued the relief; and (2)  may not be enforced or obeyed by an officer, employee, or agent, including a judicial official, of this state or a political subdivision of this state. (b)  Notwithstanding any other law, a writ, injunction, or declaratory judgment issued by a court of this state that purports to restrain a person, including the state, a political subdivision of this state, or an officer or employee of this state or a political subdivision of this state, from hearing, adjudicating, docketing, or filing an action brought under Section 171A.101, 171A.151, or 171A.201: (1)  is considered void and a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and (2)  may not be enforced or obeyed by an officer, employee, or agent, including a judicial official, of this state or a political subdivision of this state. Sec. 171A.457.  LIABILITY FOR VIOLATION. (a) Notwithstanding any other law, a person may bring an action against an officer, employee, or agent, including a judicial official, of this state or a political subdivision of this state, who issues, enforces, or obeys a writ, injunction, or declaratory judgment described by Subsection (b) if the writ, injunction, or judgment prevents or delays the person from bringing an action under Section 171A.101, 171A.151, or 171A.201. (b)  A claimant who prevails in an action brought under this section is entitled to: (1)  injunctive relief; (2)  compensatory damages; (3)  exemplary damages of not less than $100,000; and (4)  costs and reasonable attorney's fees. (c)  Notwithstanding any other law, in an action brought under this section, a person who violates Section 171A.455 or 171A.456(b): (1)  may not assert and is not entitled to any type of immunity defense, including sovereign immunity, governmental immunity, official immunity, or judicial immunity; (2)  may not be indemnified for an award of damages or costs and attorney's fees entered against the person or for the costs of the person's legal defense; and (3)  may not receive or obtain legal representation from the attorney general. Sec. 171A.458.  ACTION TO RECOVER COSTS. (a) Notwithstanding any other law, a claimant who brings an action seeking a writ, injunction, or declaratory judgment that would restrain a person from hearing, adjudicating, docketing, or filing an action under Section 171A.101, 171A.151, or 171A.201 is liable to the person for the person's costs and attorney's fees incurred in connection with the action. (b)  A person entitled to recover costs and attorney's fees under this section may bring an action in state or federal court. (c)  It is not a defense to an action brought under this section that: (1)  the claimant failed to seek recovery of costs or attorney's fees in the underlying action; (2)  the court in the underlying action declined to recognize or enforce this section; or (3)  the court in the underlying action held that any provisions of this section are invalid, unconstitutional, or preempted by federal law, notwithstanding the doctrines of issue or claim preclusion. SECTION 4.  Section 71.02(a), Penal Code, is amended to read as follows: (a)  A person commits an offense if, with the intent to establish, maintain, or participate in a combination or in the profits of a combination or as a member of a criminal street gang, the person commits or conspires to commit one or more of the following: (1)  murder, capital murder, arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, burglary, theft, aggravated kidnapping, kidnapping, aggravated assault, aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, continuous sexual abuse of young child or disabled individual, solicitation of a minor, forgery, deadly conduct, assault punishable as a Class A misdemeanor, burglary of a motor vehicle, or unauthorized use of a motor vehicle; (2)  any gambling offense punishable as a Class A misdemeanor; (3)  promotion of prostitution, aggravated promotion of prostitution, or compelling prostitution; (4)  unlawful manufacture, transportation, repair, or sale of firearms or prohibited weapons; (5)  unlawful manufacture, delivery, dispensation, or distribution of a controlled substance or dangerous drug, or unlawful possession of a controlled substance or dangerous drug through forgery, fraud, misrepresentation, or deception; (5-a) causing the unlawful delivery, dispensation, or distribution of a controlled substance or dangerous drug in violation of Subtitle B, Title 3, Occupations Code; (6)  any unlawful wholesale promotion or possession of any obscene material or obscene device with the intent to wholesale promote the same; (7)  any offense under Subchapter B, Chapter 43, depicting or involving conduct by or directed toward a child younger than 18 years of age; (8)  any felony offense under Chapter 32; (9)  any offense under Chapter 36; (10)  any offense under Chapter 34, 35, or 35A; (11)  any offense under Section 37.11(a); (12)  any offense under Chapter 20A; (13)  any offense under Section 37.10; (14)  any offense under Section 38.06, 38.07, 38.09, or 38.11; (15)  any offense under Section 42.10; (16)  any offense under Section 46.06(a)(1) or 46.14; (17)  any offense under Section 20.05 or 20.06; (18)  any offense under Section 16.02; [or] (19)  any offense classified as a felony under the Tax Code; (20)  a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1462(c); (21)  a violation of an abortion law under Chapter 170, 170A, 171, or 171A, Health and Safety Code, or Chapter 6-1/2, Title 71, Revised Statutes; and (22)  an offense under Chapter 28 directed at a church, a crisis pregnancy center, an adoption agency, or an entity that offers alternatives to abortion services. SECTION 5.  (a)  Mindful of Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U.S. 137 (1996), in which in the context of determining the severability of a state statute regulating abortion the United States Supreme Court held that an explicit statement of legislative intent is controlling, it is the intent of the legislature that every provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word in this Act, and every application of the provisions in this Act to every person, group of persons, or circumstances, are severable from each other. (b)  If any application of any provision in this Act to any person, group of persons, or circumstances is found by a court to be invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional, for any reason whatsoever, then the remaining applications of that provision to all other persons and circumstances shall be severed and preserved, and shall remain in effect. All constitutionally valid applications of the provisions in this Act shall be severed from any applications that a court finds to be invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional, because it is the legislature's intent and priority that every single valid application of every statutory provision be allowed to stand alone. (c)  The legislature further declares that it would have enacted this Act, and each provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word, and all constitutional applications of the provisions of this Act, irrespective of the fact that any provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word, or applications of this Act were to be declared invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional. (d)  If any provision of this Act is found by any court to be unconstitutionally vague, then the applications of that provision that do not present constitutional vagueness problems shall be severed and remain in force, consistent with the severability requirements of Subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section. (e)  No court may decline to enforce the severability requirements of Subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section on the ground that severance would rewrite the statute or involve the court in legislative or lawmaking activity. A court that declines to enforce or enjoins a state official from enforcing a statutory provision is not rewriting a statute or engaging in legislative or lawmaking activity, as the statute continues to contain the same words as before the court's decision. A judicial injunction or declaration of unconstitutionality: (1)  is nothing more than an edict prohibiting enforcement of the disputed statute against the named parties to that lawsuit, which may subsequently be vacated by a later court if that court has a different understanding of the requirements of the Texas Constitution or United States Constitution; (2)  is not a formal amendment of the language in a statute; and (3)  no more rewrites a statute than a decision by the executive not to enforce a duly enacted statute in a limited and defined set of circumstances. (f)  If any state or federal court disregards any of the severability requirements in Subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, and declares or finds any provision of this Act facially invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional, when there are discrete applications of that provision that can be enforced against a person, a group of persons, or circumstances without violating federal law or the United States Constitution or Texas Constitution, then that provision shall be interpreted, as a matter of state law, as if the legislature had enacted a provision limited to the persons, group of persons, or circumstances for which the provision's application will not violate federal law or the United States Constitution or Texas Constitution, and every court shall adopt this saving construction of that provision until the court ruling that pronounced the provision facially invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional is vacated or overruled. SECTION 6.  Chapter 171A, Health and Safety Code, as added by this Act, applies only to a cause of action that accrues on or after the effective date of this Act. SECTION 7.  Section 71.02, Penal Code, as amended by this Act, applies only to an offense committed on or after the effective date of this Act.  An offense committed before the effective date of this Act is governed by the law in effect on the date the offense was committed, and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.  For purposes of this section, an offense was committed before the effective date of this Act if any element of the offense occurred before that date. SECTION 8.  This Act takes effect September 1, 2025.
