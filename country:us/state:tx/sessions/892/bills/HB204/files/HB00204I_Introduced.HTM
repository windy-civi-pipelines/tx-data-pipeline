Sec. 12-a.  Tax Collector's Reports.  If at any time after the enactment of this law, the Legislature of the State of Texas shall make any donation or grant or diversion or remission of taxes to or affecting a county in the District [Harris County, Texas,] or the District [flood control district herein created, in H.B. 24 or in H.B. 158, Acts Regular Session, Forty-fifth Legislature], at the end of each month [after the effective date of such Act,] the Assessor and Collector of Taxes of each county in the District [Harris County] shall make an itemized report under oath to the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas on forms to be furnished by the Comptroller showing each and every item of the State taxes collected by him upon property and from persons within the District; and he shall accompany the same with an itemized statement listing all taxes received and showing full disposal of all such taxes collected.  The said Assessor and Collector of Taxes shall forward his report to the Comptroller, and shall make a like report to the Treasurer [County Auditor,] and [he shall] pay over to the [County] Treasurer all moneys collected by him as State taxes so donated or granted under Legislative authority, less such amounts as are allowed by law for assessing and collecting same, and shall remit the balance to the proper authority as required by then existing laws. The Board [Commissioners Court], in its discretion, may utilize the tax funds donated and granted by the State of Texas for the construction of flood control improvements and other improvements and purposes authorized by such enactments and the maintenance or operation thereof; or may deposit the same in a sinking fund to pay interest on and to redeem bonds of said District or other obligations issued for such purposes, in the manner hereinafter provided. Sec. 12-b.  Issuance of Bonds.  The District may [County of Harris, Texas, acting by and through its Commissioners Court, shall have authority and it is hereby authorized to] issue [its] negotiable bonds secured by a pledge of [any such] taxes hereafter donated, granted, diverted or remitted by the State of Texas to [it or] the [Flood Control] District [created herein by the terms of H.B. 24 or H.B. 158 of the Regular Session, Forty-fifth Legislature], and the proceeds of the sale of such bonds may be used for purchasing lands, easements, right of ways, structures, and for the construction of improvements, including dams, reservoirs, and all other works suitable for use in connection with the flood control program and projects in the District [said County] and the maintenance and operation thereof, and doing all things necessary to the execution of the purposes for which the grant and donation is made; provided, however, that the aggregate amount of bonds to be issued shall not exceed such sum as the donation and grant of the State taxes will service so as to pay interest and to create a sinking fund sufficient to pay said bonds at maturity. In the event the Board [Commissioners Court of Harris County, Texas,] shall determine by a majority vote on a Resolution entered of record, giving the reasons therefor and showing that a necessity exists for utilizing any tax funds hereafter donated and granted by the State of Texas for the issuance of bonds in order to facilitate the construction of improvements and make funds immediately available, said bonds may be issued in the form and manner hereinafter prescribed.  The bonds so authorized and issued in accordance with the provisions of this Act need not be issued at one time.  The amount of money necessary to provide a sinking fund to mature said bonds and to pay the interest thereon shall be set aside annually from the first of such hereafter donated and granted funds received from an [the] Assessor and Collector of Taxes and said funds may not be diverted to any other purpose.  The Board [Officers of the County] and the District's Depository are forbidden to authorize the payment of any amount from said State taxes hereafter so donated and granted until there has first been set aside therefrom an amount sufficient to cover all servicing charges for the bonds for the year.  Thereupon and after the treasurer [Auditor] has filed a certificate showing the deposit to the interest and sinking fund of a sufficient amount to cover such servicing charges for the year, any taxes hereafter donated, granted, diverted or remitted to [Harris County or] the [Flood Control] District [created herein by the State of Texas under the terms of H.B. 24 or H.B. 158, Acts Regular Session, Forty-fifth Legislature,] collected during the remainder of the year may be utilized for purposes consistent with this Act.  Should the necessity arise, the Board [Commissioners Court] may supplement from its general funds any State taxes hereafter donated and granted, but no tax shall ever be levied or any debt be created against a [the] County in the District for such purpose without a vote of the people.  Any bonds issued under this Section shall be in accordance with the provisions of Subdivisions 1 and 2 of Title 22, Revised Civil Statutes, 1925, and any amendments thereto applicable to bonds issued by a county.

The District may issue its bonds to mature serially or otherwise not to exceed thirty (30) years after their date. The governing body may also determine whether or not bonds shall contain an option of redemption, and if so, the form and date of such option. If the election be for a maintenance tax, then the ballot shall have written or printed thereon the words "For the Flood Control Maintenance Tax" and, "Against the Flood Control Maintenance Tax," and the voter shall strike out one of said expressions, leaving the other standing as his vote. When authorized, the Board may thereafter levy annually a tax sufficient to operate and maintain works and improvements owned or constructed by the District, provided the amount of such tax does not exceed the limit authorized. Sec. 3.  The Board shall have authority to issue refunding bonds bearing the same or a lower rate of interest to refund any bonds of the District theretofore issued and outstanding. Refunding bonds may be issued serially or otherwise for any term of years not exceeding thirty (30). Statutes governing refunding of county bonds shall apply to refunding bonds of the [Harris County Flood Control] District so far as applicable, except where otherwise expressly provided by the laws relating to said District. SECTION 4.  Section 4, Chapter 118, Acts of the 58th Legislature, Regular Session, 1963, is amended to read as follows: Sec. 4.  a.  After the governing body of the District has completed such hearings and shall have found that the establishing of such building setback lines is for the public health, safety and general welfare of the people within the District, and for the accomplishment of the purposes of Section 59 of Article XVI of the Constitution of the State of Texas, as amended, said governing body shall pass its resolution adopting such building setback lines. Such resolution shall contain a description of the area included within such building setback lines by either field notes or by map or plat or by both, and a certified copy thereof shall be filed for record immediately with the County Clerk of the affected county [of Harris County]. b.  Thereafter the governing body of the District may, upon public hearing with like notice thereof, amend, supplement, grant exceptions thereto, or alter the building setback lines so established as may be determined necessary under the same standards as provided in "a" above.

Sec. 12-a.  Tax Collector's Reports.  If at any time after the enactment of this law, the Legislature of the State of Texas shall make any donation or grant or diversion or remission of taxes to or affecting a county in the District [Harris County, Texas,] or the District [flood control district herein created, in H.B. 24 or in H.B. 158, Acts Regular Session, Forty-fifth Legislature], at the end of each month [after the effective date of such Act,] the Assessor and Collector of Taxes of each county in the District [Harris County] shall make an itemized report under oath to the Comptroller of Public Accounts of the State of Texas on forms to be furnished by the Comptroller showing each and every item of the State taxes collected by him upon property and from persons within the District; and he shall accompany the same with an itemized statement listing all taxes received and showing full disposal of all such taxes collected.  The said Assessor and Collector of Taxes shall forward his report to the Comptroller, and shall make a like report to the Treasurer [County Auditor,] and [he shall] pay over to the [County] Treasurer all moneys collected by him as State taxes so donated or granted under Legislative authority, less such amounts as are allowed by law for assessing and collecting same, and shall remit the balance to the proper authority as required by then existing laws. The Board [Commissioners Court], in its discretion, may utilize the tax funds donated and granted by the State of Texas for the construction of flood control improvements and other improvements and purposes authorized by such enactments and the maintenance or operation thereof; or may deposit the same in a sinking fund to pay interest on and to redeem bonds of said District or other obligations issued for such purposes, in the manner hereinafter provided. Sec. 12-b.  Issuance of Bonds.  The District may [County of Harris, Texas, acting by and through its Commissioners Court, shall have authority and it is hereby authorized to] issue [its] negotiable bonds secured by a pledge of [any such] taxes hereafter donated, granted, diverted or remitted by the State of Texas to [it or] the [Flood Control] District [created herein by the terms of H.B. 24 or H.B. 158 of the Regular Session, Forty-fifth Legislature], and the proceeds of the sale of such bonds may be used for purchasing lands, easements, right of ways, structures, and for the construction of improvements, including dams, reservoirs, and all other works suitable for use in connection with the flood control program and projects in the District [said County] and the maintenance and operation thereof, and doing all things necessary to the execution of the purposes for which the grant and donation is made; provided, however, that the aggregate amount of bonds to be issued shall not exceed such sum as the donation and grant of the State taxes will service so as to pay interest and to create a sinking fund sufficient to pay said bonds at maturity. In the event the Board [Commissioners Court of Harris County, Texas,] shall determine by a majority vote on a Resolution entered of record, giving the reasons therefor and showing that a necessity exists for utilizing any tax funds hereafter donated and granted by the State of Texas for the issuance of bonds in order to facilitate the construction of improvements and make funds immediately available, said bonds may be issued in the form and manner hereinafter prescribed.  The bonds so authorized and issued in accordance with the provisions of this Act need not be issued at one time.  The amount of money necessary to provide a sinking fund to mature said bonds and to pay the interest thereon shall be set aside annually from the first of such hereafter donated and granted funds received from an [the] Assessor and Collector of Taxes and said funds may not be diverted to any other purpose.  The Board [Officers of the County] and the District's Depository are forbidden to authorize the payment of any amount from said State taxes hereafter so donated and granted until there has first been set aside therefrom an amount sufficient to cover all servicing charges for the bonds for the year.  Thereupon and after the treasurer [Auditor] has filed a certificate showing the deposit to the interest and sinking fund of a sufficient amount to cover such servicing charges for the year, any taxes hereafter donated, granted, diverted or remitted to [Harris County or] the [Flood Control] District [created herein by the State of Texas under the terms of H.B. 24 or H.B. 158, Acts Regular Session, Forty-fifth Legislature,] collected during the remainder of the year may be utilized for purposes consistent with this Act.  Should the necessity arise, the Board [Commissioners Court] may supplement from its general funds any State taxes hereafter donated and granted, but no tax shall ever be levied or any debt be created against a [the] County in the District for such purpose without a vote of the people.  Any bonds issued under this Section shall be in accordance with the provisions of Subdivisions 1 and 2 of Title 22, Revised Civil Statutes, 1925, and any amendments thereto applicable to bonds issued by a county.

The District may issue its bonds to mature serially or otherwise not to exceed thirty (30) years after their date. The governing body may also determine whether or not bonds shall contain an option of redemption, and if so, the form and date of such option. If the election be for a maintenance tax, then the ballot shall have written or printed thereon the words "For the Flood Control Maintenance Tax" and, "Against the Flood Control Maintenance Tax," and the voter shall strike out one of said expressions, leaving the other standing as his vote. When authorized, the Board may thereafter levy annually a tax sufficient to operate and maintain works and improvements owned or constructed by the District, provided the amount of such tax does not exceed the limit authorized. Sec. 3.  The Board shall have authority to issue refunding bonds bearing the same or a lower rate of interest to refund any bonds of the District theretofore issued and outstanding.
