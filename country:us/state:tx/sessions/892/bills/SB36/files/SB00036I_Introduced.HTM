(d)  Any money made available to a unit of election under Subsection (c) that is unused by the unit of election in the period described by that subsection must be used by the authority to pay down any outstanding debt that is secured by a sales and use tax rate imposed at a rate of one percent.  A payment made under this subsection is in addition to any annual debt payment required of the authority. SECTION 2.  Section 452.357(a), Transportation Code, is amended to read as follows: (a)  To secure the payment of an authority's bonds, the authority may: (1)  pledge not more than 75 percent [all or part] of revenue realized from any tax that the authority may impose; (2)  pledge any part of the revenue of the public transportation system; (3)  mortgage any part of the public transportation system, including any part of the system subsequently acquired; (4)  pledge all or part of funds the federal government has committed to the authority as grants in aid; and (5)  provide that a pledge of revenue described by Subdivision (1) or (2) is a first lien or charge against that revenue.

Notwithstanding Subchapter H, on receipt by the executive committee of the authority of a notice provided under Section 452.655(c), the authority may not issue notes, bonds, or other obligations if the issuance would cause the financial obligation of the unit of election under Section 452.659(a) to accrue because the amount in Section 452.659(b)(3) would increase.  This limitation on issuance continues until: (1)  the effective date of the withdrawal of the unit of election from the authority, if after an election held under Section 452.655 less than a majority of the votes received on the measure in the election favor the proposition; or (2)  the day after the date of the canvass of an election held under Section 452.655, if a majority of the votes received on the measure in the election favor the proposition.

SECTION 7.  This Act takes effect on the 91st day after the last day of the legislative session.
